# Supermarket-Dashboard

This Project is an in-depth analysis of sales performance of a SuperMarket for the year 2012 to year 2015. The Dashboard created for the same comprises of the following visual components.

A **_Slicer_** for Years and Quarters to be selected.

2 **_KPI Cards_** to monitor the **Sales** and **Profit** of the supermarket with trend axis set to "Quarter" and target as "Previous Quarter Sales" and "Previous Quarter Profit".

Then we have 2 **_Cards_** that show **Order Quanty** and **Average Delivery Duration**.

Besides that we have a **_Map_** that captures the region of sales for the supermarket.

Next up we have 2 **_Donut Charts_** that speaks up for **Sales by Segment** and **Sales by Market**.

Next we have a **_Card_** that shows the **Top Customer Name** filtered by Sales.

2 more **_Cards_** are added to show the **Sales** and **Profit** made from the top customer.

And the last visual component of the dashboard is the **_Matrix_** that has the **Drill Down** functionality for the **Category Hierarchy** that has ["Category", Sub-Category and Product Name] with values set for Quantity, Sales and Profit

Lastly every visuals can be used as a filter which can affect / interact with other visuals of the Supermarket Dashboard.
